# End to End Time Series Analysis of Stock Data
> This is a demonstration of how Time Series Analysis can help us forecast various
> financial parameters which we always need to project for our financial analysis.

In this particular excercise I have tried to demonstrate my skills in terms of statistical methods and machine learning.
The notebooks that I have wrote is focused on the time-series analysis.

# Steps that I have followed
In this practice, I made sure the full process is well organized and documented.
- I have mentioned all the dependencies in the `requirements.txt`
- You may install them inside a virtual environment
- Head on to the data folder to generate and store data. I have provided a notebook that will help you bootstrap the process.
- Then I have trained several stats models based on AR, MA and their combination
- After that I have trained the facebook prophet model
- Finally, trained the deep learning model based on LSTM

# Findings and Comment
After going through all the process, I found out that deep learning models actually generalize better and have the minimum amount of error.
It will be best to have a deep learning model fine tuned to do all the predictions and forecastings.

I have deployed a working version of the deep learning model. Please checkout the description of this repo to find out the link to that.
